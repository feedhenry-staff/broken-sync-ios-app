We needed to have an IOS app that has compile problems in it.
In order to that, https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/sync-ios-app is forked and bunch of syntax errors are added.

We forked https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/sync-ios-app so that it doesn't have this confusing branch.
Templates are to be used by FeedHenry (RHMAP) users, we don't want to make them confused.
